Hi! Welcome to the Lewisham COVID-19 Mutual Aid website. Please read this page first before exploring.

**What is mutual aid?** A voluntary reciprocal exchange of resources and services for mutual benefit. Based on non-hierarchical principles. We want to support each other and not wait for central government to get their act together.
No one here is doing this for money, nor are we professionals or politicians. We're just concerned people who believe in solidarity and are doing something about it.

Lewisham is really big, so we've organised ourselves around wards, and within that polling districts, or even streets.

**Wards:** Geographical areas that correspond to voting wards.
Polling districts: Geographical areas that are subdivisions of individual wards.
Local groups: Some people have chosen to organise themselves outside of wards, in groups like estates and tenants associations.

**Reps:** Each group should choose a rep who acts a main point of contact between their group and the Borough coordination group. You can find their information on the relevant tabs.

**By area:** Lists all the area-specific groups that have formed up. 

**Leaflet templates:** This is where we share templates for leaflets or posters so other groups can use them. It also includes resources in other common languages in Lewisham.

**Support local workers/businesses:** Ways you can help local workers and businesses who might need support.
